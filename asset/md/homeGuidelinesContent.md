### Mandatory Information
- Name of your Character
- Record value
- Screenshot or video clearly showing the record (some records necessarily require a video)

### Screenshot and Video Requirements
- Screenshots must be full-sized
- Videos should show the record without too much editing (e.g. add a clear replay)
- The status (H) or messenger (E) window must be visible
- Censoring should be as small as possible
- Censor only with colored rectangles
- Well-known players support the plausibility

### Decision of Acknowledgment
The decision to acknowledge a record is always done by the MONZTArecord Team. The last word is with them.
